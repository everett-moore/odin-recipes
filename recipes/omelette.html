        This recipe, on <a href="https://www.acouplecooks.com/omelette-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acouplescooks.com</a>
        is a classic french style Omelette, golden and delicious!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 grinds fresh black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon water</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shredded cheese</li>
        <li>For filling, you can have all sorts of things, like peppers, mushrooms, and various greens of your choosing.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, crack the eggs. With a fork, whisk vigorously together with the kosher salt, pepper and water.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a skillet below high heat, then pour in eggs.</li>
        <li>When a skin just starts to form after 10 to 15 seconds, add the cheese (and other filling ingredients) in a line from left to right.</li>
        <li> Cook another 10 to 15 seconds until just barely set; the outside should be a pale golden and the inside soft and creamy.</li>
        <li>: To remove the omelette, hold a plate in one hand. Then pick up the pan with your right hand, thumb up, and quickly turn the pan upside down over the plate so that the omelette rolls off onto the middle of the plate, folding over itself into a rolled shape.</li>
    </ol>
